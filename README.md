# Lebron-Builder

A fun little interactive project inspired by the GOAT LeBron James. This was my first attempt at building something more engaging, where users can select different options and even discover a hidden Easter egg if all inputs are correct.

It was a great way to learn how various elements work together, and to improve my understanding of organizing images and CSS for a consistent, polished look.
